nyat-sendmail(5)

# NAME

nyat-sendmail - sendmail configuration for *nyat*(1)

# SYNOPSIS

nyat can defer to sendmail for the delivery of outgoing messages.

# CONFIGURATION

In accounts.conf (see *nyat-config*(5)), the following sendmail-specific
options are available:

*outgoing*
	/path/to/sendmail

	This should be set to the path to the sendmail binary you wish to use,
	which is generally /usr/bin/sendmail. nyat will execute it with a list of
	recipients on the command line and pipe the message to deliver to stdin.
