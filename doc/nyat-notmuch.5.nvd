nyat-notmuch(5)

# NAME

nyat-notmuch - notmuch configuration for *nyat*(1)

# SYNOPSIS

nyat supports using the notmuch email system as a backend, for fast indexing
and searching.

For this to be enabled, nyat needs to be build with notmuch support.++
Refer to the installation instructions for details.

# CONFIGURATION

Notmuch accounts currently are not supported with the :new-account command and
must be added manually.

In accounts.conf (see *nyat-config*(5)), the following notmuch-specific
options are available:

*source*
	notmuch://path

	The *source* indicates the path to the directory containing your notmuch
	database (usually a .notmuch folder).

	The path portion of the URL following _notmuch://_ must be either an absolute
	path prefixed by */* or a path relative to your home directory prefixed with
	*~*. For example:

		source = notmuch:///home/me/mail

		source = notmuch://~/mail

*query-map*
	Path to a file containing a mapping from display name to notmuch query in
	the form of NAME=QUERY.++
Multiple entries can be specified, one per line.++
Lines starting with '#' are ignored and serve as comments.

	e.g. inbox=tag:inbox and not tag:archived

	Default: none

*exclude-tags*
	Comma separated list of tags which will be excluded from query results,
	unless explicitly mentioned in the query.++
This can for example be useful if you use an archive or spam tag.

	Default: none

# USAGE

Notmuch shows slightly different behaviour than for example imap.++
Some commands are simply unsupported because they have no proper counterpart
in notmuch, like :delete and :archive.++
Others are slightly different in semantics and mentioned below:

*cf* <notmuch query>
	The change folder command allows for arbitrary notmuch queries and should
	usually be preferred over *:filter* as it will be much faster if you use
	the notmuch database to do the filtering
