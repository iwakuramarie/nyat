nyat-templates(7)

# NAME

nyat-templates - template file specification for *nyat*(1)

# SYNOPSIS

nyat uses the go "text/template" package for the template parsing.
Refer to the go text/template documentation for the general syntax.

Template files are composed of headers, followed by a newline, followed by the
body text.

Example:

```
X-Clacks-Overhead: GNU Terry Pratchett

Hello,

Greetings,
Chuck
```

If you have a template that doesn't add any header, it *must* be preceded by a
newline, to avoid parsing parts of the body as header text.

# MESSAGE DATA

The following data can be used in templates. Though they are not all
available always.

*Addresses*
	An array of mail.Address. That can be used to add sender or recipient
	names to the template.

	- From: List of senders.
	- To: List of To recipients. Not always Available.
	- Cc: List of Cc recipients. Not always Available.
	- Bcc: List of Cc recipients. Not always Available.
	- OriginalFrom: List of senders of the original message.
	  Available for quoted reply and forward.

	Example:

	Get the name of the first sender.
	```
	{{(index .From 0).Name}}
	```

	Get the email address of the first sender.
	```
	{{(index .From 0).Address}}
	```

*Date and Time*
	The date and time information is always available and can be easily
	formatted.

	- Date: Date and Time information when the compose window is opened.
	- OriginalDate: Date and Time when the original message of received.

	  "text/plain" or "text/html".

*Original Message*

# TEMPLATE FUNCTIONS

Besides the standard functions described in go's text/template documentation,
nyat provides the following additional functions:

*wrap*
	Wrap the original text to the specified number of characters per line.

	```
	{{wrap 72 .OriginalText}}
	```

*quote*
	Prepends each line with "> ".

	```
	{{quote .OriginalText}}
	```

*exec*
	Execute external command, provide the second argument to its stdin.

	```
	{{exec `/usr/local/share/nyat/filters/html` .OriginalText}}
	```

*toLocal*
	Convert the date to the local timezone as specified by the locale.

	```
	{{toLocal .Date}}
	```

*dateFormat*
	Format date and time according to the format passed as the second argument.
	The format must be specified according to go's time package format.

*version*

*Function chaining*
	All of the template functions can be chained together if needed.

	```
	{{if eq .OriginalMIMEType "text/html"}}
	{{exec `/usr/local/share/nyat/filters/html` .OriginalText | wrap 72 | quote}}
	{{else}}
	{{wrap 72 .OriginalText | quote}}
	{{end}}
	```
